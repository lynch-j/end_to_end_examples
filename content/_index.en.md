# pharmaverse examples

The true beauty of pharmaverse (and open source in general) is when efforts from various
different developers come together to compliment each other as a whole greater than the
sum of the individual parts. 

Here, we try to exemplify this by sharing end-to-end examples that show how various
pharmaverse packages can be combined to achieve common clinical reporting needs, such
as SDTM, ADaM and Tables/Listings/Graphs. Our earliest examples focus on ADaM, but over
time we'll endeavour to add further examples.
